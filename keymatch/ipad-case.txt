Title: Targus Click-In Rotating Case for 10.5 iPad Pro
Description: 
    Black
  The versatile Targus Click-In Rotating case for 10.5-inch iPad Pro is both protective and functional. Any angle Designed to work as both a stand and a case 
   this slim sleeve can rotate between landscape and portrait modes to suit the situation. The stand's angle can be adjusted too 
   giving you the perfect position for viewing and typing comfort. Top protection The case has been carefully constructed with a reinforced frame that will hug your iPad Pro's curves to ensure it stays in place. A raised bezel provides extra protection against drops (up to 1.2m/4ft) and bumps 
   while an elastic band will keep your cover securely closed. Fitting guide: If the iPad Pro is fitted into the case bottom first (i.e. the end with the lightning cable dock) then the cable can be connected without any issues. When the iPad Pro is fitted into the case any other side first 
   then it is possible for the cable dock to be slightly misaligned with the cable cut-out on the case - meaning it can be a tight fit to connect the cable. This issue - if it arises - can therefore be easily resolved by re-fitting the iPad Pro back into the case 
   bottom side first and ensuring it is fully clicked into place.

   iOS  Wi-Fi  512GB Silver The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a screen nearly 20 per cent larger than the 9.7-inch model 
   so you get more room to do more. It also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard 
   yet it's just as portable as ever. No matter the task  the iPad Pro is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   while being delightfully simple to use. Its redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective

   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality.

Title: 2017 Apple iPad Pro 12.9
Description: 
    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  256GB Silver No matter the task  the iPad Pro 12.9 is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your iPad or make secure purchases on the App Store 
   iTunes and iBooks. Your fingerprint information stays on your iPad- it's not shared with anyone 
   even Apple  helping to ensure that your personal information remains private.

Description: 
    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  64GB Gold No matter the task  the iPad Pro 12.9 is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your iPad or make secure purchases on the App Store 
   iTunes and iBooks. Your fingerprint information stays on your iPad- it's not shared with anyone 
   even Apple  helping to ensure that your personal information remains private.

    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  64GB Silver The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a screen nearly 20 per cent larger than the 9.7-inch model 
   so you get more room to do more. It also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard 
   yet it's just as portable as ever. No matter the task  this iPad Pro is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   while being delightfully simple to use. Its redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your device or make secure purchases on the App Store 
   iTunes and iBooks. Your fingerprint information stays on your iPad Pro - it's not shared with anyone

Title: Case Robin Day 675 Chair Oak/Black
Description: 
   A design that has truly stood the test of time
   this 675 chair is the authentic licensed production of the original 1952 design 
   endorsed by the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. The chair's most prominent feature is its curved walnut-veneered plywood back. Pioneering at the time 
   Robin Day overcame the difficulty of forming a single moulded plywood chair with armrests by creating a bent shape using a singular curve rather than a double curve. In close collaboration with the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation 
   Case has revised the dimensions of the chair  making the 2014 version slightly smaller and more compact - as it was originally designed to be. Finished with a walnut-veneered ply back 
   black powder-coated steel frame and black leather upholstered seat pad - in the words of Robin Day: ‘metal for strength and lightness ... wood for touch and appearance.' The 675 is comfortable for long periods of use thanks to the large seat pad 
   and is equally at home in your office and dining space. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in our shops. For more information 
   please speak to a furniture Partner in store  or call 03452 661805 and we can tell you where the range you'd like to view is on display. - Oak/Black - Leather

    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  64GB Gold The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a screen nearly 20 per cent larger than the 9.7-inch model 
   so you get more room to do more. It also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard 
   yet it's just as portable as ever. No matter the task  this iPad Pro is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   while being delightfully simple to use. Its redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations.

This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your device or make secure purchases on the App Store

   you can optimise any part of a picture when you're reviewing a day's haul. The 0.2” Live View Finder is ideal for giving you a perfect view of the frame even in the brightest sunlight. It automatically turns on when you hold it up to your eyes

Title: Case Robin Day 675 Chair Walnut/Black
Description: 
   A design that has truly stood the test of time
   this 675 chair is the authentic licensed production of the original 1952 design 
   endorsed by the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation. The chair's most prominent feature is its curved walnut-veneered plywood back. Pioneering at the time 
   Robin Day overcame the difficulty of forming a single moulded plywood chair with armrests by creating a bent shape using a singular curve rather than a double curve. In close collaboration with the Robin and Lucienne Day Foundation 
   Case has revised the dimensions of the chair  making the 2014 version slightly smaller and more compact - as it was originally designed to be. Finished with a walnut-veneered ply back 
   black powder-coated steel frame and black leather upholstered seat pad - in the words of Robin Day: ‘metal for strength and lightness ... wood for touch and appearance.' The 675 is comfortable for long periods of use thanks to the large seat pad 
   and is equally at home in your office and dining space. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in our shops. For more information 
   please speak to a furniture Partner in store  or call 03452 661805 and we can tell you where the range you'd like to view is on display. - Walnut/Black - Leather

Title: Matthew Hilton for Case Cross Extending Dining Table
Description: 
    Oak
  The award-winning Cross Extending Dining Table by Matthew Hilton is a fine example of advanced wood manufacturing techniques. The elegant lines of this modern design create a distinctly up-to-date piece which is practical and adaptable. Made from solid wood with a veneered chamfered edged top 
   it has two extendable leaves (each 50cm) to seat up to 14 members of the family around it. The table can be extended to three sizes (2m 
   2.5m and 3m) so you can accommodate any occasion. It's comfortably large 
   yet retains a visual balance due to the proportions of the table top. The functional design of the base is sturdy 
   handsome and built for multiple uses. Matthew Hilton worked as an industrial designer and model maker until 1984 when he set up his own design studio/workshop. Two years later he launched a series of shelves at the Milan Furniture Fair 
   and in 1991 he designed the Balzac Armchair  which was embraced as a modern classic. Since then 
   Hilton's work has taken on a less stylistic  more functional approach. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in our shops. For more information

Title: Crayola My Painting Case Kit
Description: 
   Crayola was founded in New York city in 1885 by cousins Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith. It started out as an industrial pigment supply company and it wasn't until 1900 that they shifted focus towards art products
   producing slate school pencils. This experimentation eventually led to Binney producing the world's first dustless white chalk 
   paving the way for Crayola to become a household name and a leader in the industry of art products for home and school use. Nowadays they are most famous for their crayons 
   so it is quite surprising that it took them 20 years to produce their first prototype 
   in 1905. It was this year that they released the No. 8 crayon box 
   which featured eight different coloured crayons. It was from there that they carried on expanding their range 
   creating a wide variety of different colours. In 1958 they released a 64-colour pack that introduced their very first in-built crayon sharpener. To mark their 75th anniversary in 1978 
   they debuted their range of Crayola markers  the success of which led them to develop coloured pencils and washable markers in 1987. All Crayola-branded products are marketed as non-toxic and safe for use by children 
 being sold in over 80 countries. - Plastic - Unisex
