Description: 
    Black
  Bring cinema-quality sound into the living room with LG's SK5 sound bar. High Resolution Audio ensures studio quality sound within an immersive soundscape thanks to DTS: Virtual X tech. And the brand's Adaptive Sound Control and Auto Sound Engine are always optimising the output depending on content and volume level. A separate subwoofer takes care of the bass frequencies for a thunderous power that you can feel 
   while built-in Bluetooth means it's simple to play music direct from your smart device. Give a sparkling cinematic makeover to all your audio and visual entertainment. High Resolution Audio This 2.1 channel system boasts total audio power of 360W so you won't be short of volume. High Resolution Audio means studio quality sound 
   just as the artist originally intended. Based on encoding and playback at a higher sampling rate than standard 
   high and low frequencies are extended for a greater level of detail across the whole sonic range. Immersive Audio DTS Virtual X creates a three dimensional sound stage by firing sound vertically and horizontally for a fully immersive listening experience. Adaptive Audio This LG sound bar is primed to deliver the best possible sound at all times. Adaptive Sound Control automatically tunes the frequency settings to produce the prime balance of EQ depending on what you're watching 
   while Auto Sound Engine optimises the audio depending on the volume level. And you can choose between three Enhanced Sound Modes which best suit the type of entertainment you're enjoying. Wireless Subwoofer The separate subwoofer provides booming bass and sub-bass frequencies that bring your entertainment to powerful life and make you feel part of the action. And because it connects wirelessly with the main sound bar you have greater flexibility on where to place it for maximum impact. Brilliant Bluetooth Armed with Bluetooth you can pair up your smart device simply and wirelessly to give your favourite tunes a stunning new lease of audio life. Sleek Harmonious Design Artfully constructed from premium but lightweight materials the SK5 has a beautifully sleek profile. It also perfectly matches select LG TVs (43 and above) for a fully integrated audio visual partnership. It comes with its own remote 
   but can also be controlled with the remote of many TV manufacturers to cut down the clutter. Delivery information : If you buy a large screen TV along with this item

   Black Bring superb cinema sound into the home with LG's SJ8 sound bar. This elegant 
   slim-line speaker system provides top-quality High Resolution Audio sound to every corner of the living room for a rich 
   powerful  clear and immersive sonic spectrum. A separate wireless subwoofer takes care of the bass frequencies for a thunderous power that you can feel. Built-in Chromecast opens up a wealth of streaming options 
   while Bluetooth means it's simple to play music direct from your smart device. The SJ8 will revolutionise the sound of all the audio and visual entertainment you enjoy.

   durable and resistant to rot and decay  this furniture requires little maintenance Eucalyptus (Better) Distinctive scent and appearance which darkens as it ages. Provides similar natural benefits to teak including moisture resistance 
   hardness and durability. It's plentiful in supply which makes the furniture an inexpensive choice. This wood can be treated to have a different appearance 
   like our Islay range Karri Gum (Eucalyptus) An extremely strong and stable premium eucalyptus timber ideal for outdoor furniture use. Through the multi-stage timber processing 
   the timber is completely cured with no risk of leeching. Due to the high density and tight grain of the timber it is highly resistant to cracking and splitting Acacia (Good) Naturally durable 
   this wood is incredibly hard and is unlikely to suffer damage during everyday use. It provides similar natural benefits to teak

   like our Islay range Karri Gum (Eucalyptus) An extremely strong and stable premium eucalyptus timber ideal for outdoor furniture use. Through the multi-stage timber processing

Title: LG Outdoor Panama Single Rocker Chair
Description: 
    FSC-Certified (Acacia Wood)
  Create a special place to relax in the garden or conservatory with the Panama Single Rocker from LG Outdoor. This exquisitely designed chair boasts a frame and details carved from hardy and beautiful acacia wood as well as strong yet comfortable rope-weave seating. The contemporary-style weave is made from marine grade 
   premium double braided spun polyester rope  which resists salt water 
   chlorine  rain and UV light. The wood comes from an FSC-certified acacia plantation and has a brushed antique finish. A 2-year limited warranty excludes fading 
   cracking and splitting  which may occur over time as the Hanoi wood ages naturally due to the usual weathering process. These changes will add to the distressed 
   vintage appeal of the wood. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in our shops. For more information 
   please speak to a furniture Partner in store  or call 03452 661805 and we can tell you where the range you'd like to view is on display. Call 03456 065019

Strong 
   durable and resistant to rot and decay  this furniture requires little maintenance Eucalyptus (Better) Distinctive scent and appearance which darkens as it ages. Provides similar natural benefits to teak including moisture resistance 
   hardness and durability. It's plentiful in supply which makes the furniture an inexpensive choice. This wood can be treated to have a different appearance 
   like our Islay range Karri Gum (Eucalyptus) An extremely strong and stable premium eucalyptus timber ideal for outdoor furniture use. Through the multi-stage timber processing 
   the timber is completely cured with no risk of leeching. Due to the high density and tight grain of the timber it is highly resistant to cracking and splitting Acacia (Good) Naturally durable 
   this wood is incredibly hard and is unlikely to suffer damage during everyday use. It provides similar natural benefits to teak 
   yet unlike many other hardwoods  acacia is also relatively fast growing which minimises the environmental impact.
