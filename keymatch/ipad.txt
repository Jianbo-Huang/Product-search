   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive.

Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality.

   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  256GB Gold No matter the task  the iPad Pro 12.9 is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality.

   iOS11  Wi-Fi  64GB Silver The 10.5-inch iPad Pro comes with a screen nearly 20 per cent larger than the 9.7-inch model 
   so you get more room to do more. It also delivers a full-size onscreen keyboard 
   yet it's just as portable as ever. No matter the task  the iPad Pro is up to it — and then some. It offers far more power than most PC laptops 
   while being delightfully simple to use. Its redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your device or make secure purchases on the App Store 
   iTunes and iBooks. Your fingerprint information stays on your iPad Pro - it's not shared with anyone

Description: 
    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  512GB Silver No matter the task  the iPad Pro 12.9 is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your iPad or make secure purchases on the App Store 
   iTunes and iBooks. Your fingerprint information stays on your iPad- it's not shared with anyone

Description: 
    A10X Fusion
   iOS11  Wi-Fi & Cellular  64GB Gold No matter the task  the iPad Pro 12.9 is up to it — and then some. It offers more power than some PC laptops 
   yet is delightfully simple to use. The redesigned Retina display is as stunning to look at as it is to touch. Redesigned Retina display iPad has always offered the ultimate Multi-Touch experience. It's not just brighter and less reflective 
   it's far more responsive than anything that's come before. Whether you're scrolling through pages in Safari or playing an intense 3D game 
   everything feels utterly smooth  fast and immersive. The iPad Pro Retina display now supports a 120Hz refresh rate. So films and videos look spectacular 
   while games play smoothly without distracting artefacts. Fast 
   it turns out  is incredibly beautiful. And however you use the display — with your finger or Apple Pencil — everything will feel more responsive. A10X Fusion chip The A10X Fusion chip with 64‐bit architecture and six cores puts incredible power in your hands. So you can edit a 4K video on the go. Render an elaborate 3D model or create and mark up complex documents and presentations. Sound taken up a notch The four stereo speakers are built directly into the unibody shell to offer you 61 per cent more back volume compared to other iPads. This means you can enjoy three times more output to make your movie experience and gaming sessions even more mind blowing and immersive. There's a speaker in every corner delivering bass frequency 
   with the top two designed to produce a higher frequency. No need to adjust the sound when you switch from portrait to landscape as the speakers will automatically adjust to maintain optimum sound quality. Taking security seriously iPad Pro features an unprecedented level of security thanks to Touch ID. Touch ID lets you use your fingerprint as your password 
   letting you unlock your iPad or make secure purchases on the App Store

Description: 
    Black
  The versatile Targus Click-In Rotating case for 10.5-inch iPad Pro is both protective and functional. Any angle Designed to work as both a stand and a case 
   this slim sleeve can rotate between landscape and portrait modes to suit the situation. The stand's angle can be adjusted too 
   giving you the perfect position for viewing and typing comfort. Top protection The case has been carefully constructed with a reinforced frame that will hug your iPad Pro's curves to ensure it stays in place. A raised bezel provides extra protection against drops (up to 1.2m/4ft) and bumps 
   while an elastic band will keep your cover securely closed. Fitting guide: If the iPad Pro is fitted into the case bottom first (i.e. the end with the lightning cable dock) then the cable can be connected without any issues. When the iPad Pro is fitted into the case any other side first 
   then it is possible for the cable dock to be slightly misaligned with the cable cut-out on the case - meaning it can be a tight fit to connect the cable. This issue - if it arises - can therefore be easily resolved by re-fitting the iPad Pro back into the case 
   bottom side first and ensuring it is fully clicked into place.
