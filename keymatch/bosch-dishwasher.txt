   or when you fancy hosting a dinner party. This model has a maximum noise level of just 43dB - so you can get on with your day while it quietly manages the washing up. A choice of 13 programmes allows you to wash according to your needs 
   and as it only uses just under 10 litres of water per standard cycle 
   you can be sure that your dishes are being washed efficiently and your dishwasher is environmentally friendly. Quick wash An impressive 27 minute fast wash from the daily quick programme is fast 
   but incredibly powerful  suitable for a lightly soiled load. Orbital wash system Ensures precise water distribution to maintain excellent efficiency 
   so you don't waste water or energy  and you may even save on the pounds. FlexiDuo baskets Includes two separate and moveable sections that can be adjusted to best suit your dishwashing needs 
   accommodating small cups  ladles and bulky utensils. There is also a colour coordinated cutlery basket and internal trimming 
   with blue interior lighting. Delay timer Take advantage of off-peak energy costs and set a start time of up to 9 hours for your load to begin - this could also come in handy if you want a wash to finish just as you get home from work. Crystal cycle is particularly designed for delicate dishes with light dirt. A 'fast & strong' programme takes less than an hour to eliminate stubborn dirt and dried on residues. The half load option saves energy and water 
   and a 70 degree super programme is ideal for stubborn dirt. Please note: This product is slightly taller than standard worktops and as such cannot be built-in or slotted beneath a worktop. Additionally 
   a gap of 100mm must be left on the left-hand side of the product to allow the door to open.

  Built to last and tested for the equivalent of 20 years' normal use 
   the Miele G4940SC freestanding dishwasher will be a reassuring presence in any kitchen. This dishwasher has impressively low water consumption 
   partly thanks to sensor controlled washing programmes  helping it to achieve an economical A++ energy efficiency rating. Sensor control With two of its five wash programmes controlled by sensor to minimise water and energy consumption

   with a gentle touch  for glassware and china. Alternatively 
   you can just run the eco programme for an exceptionally economical wash. Under pressure Whatever programme you choose 
   you can speed things up by pressing the turbo button  reducing the cycle time by some 25% or more. Quicker washing is achieved by increasing the water pressure as well as the water temperature. Miele is believed to be the only dishwasher manufacturer to increase intensity of the wash by increasing the pressure of the water 
   as well as its temperature. Practical As you would expect from Miele 
   this dishwasher benefits from several well-thought-out  practical features from the removable cutlery tray onwards. The door is extremely easy to open and close 
   and stays open in any position. The lower  higher intensity wash basket offers a perfect position for each item of crockery. It can hold plates of various sizes (up to 35 cm diameter) in three rows. Chopping boards

   the chiller unit automatically defrosts the appliance. Consistent cooling A fan-assisted circulation system causes gentle 
   even currents of cold air at all levels of the chilling and freezing area. In this way 
   temperature fluctuations are minimised and cooling times reduced - which helps your foods retain their flavour and freshness. There are also fast freeze and fast cool facilities so food that's just been loaded into the fridge and freezer is cooled more quickly. At the same time 
   the systems stop stored prevent food from warming up. Both functions automatically return to preset operation. Independent control Two separate thermostats allow independent temperature control between the fridge and freezer 
   preventing the transference of humidity between the two sides. Touch-sensitive controls offer convenient temperature control via easy-to-read LED indicators. And alarms will warn you of any temperature increases and whether the freezer door has been left open. Versatile storage With six levels of storage 
   including two drawers in both fridge and freezer  this side-by-side appliance can easily accommodate any item you want to store. Sturdy safety glass shelves can support heavy casserole dishes 
   for example. Adjustable in-door trays mean you can adapt the space to suit individual needs for storing bottles and jars. A bright LED interior light helps you to locate particular items easily. Energy rating Low energy consumption means the appliance qualifies for an A+ energy rating.

   carefully rotated by the SoftFlow paddles before leaving your laundry soft and crease-free. ActiveAir Bosch's ActiveAir Technology is an innovative advancement of heat pump technology that's designed to work without conventional heating. The air used for drying is cost-effectively heated by the heat pump and any existing heat is re-used and recycled efficiently. AntiVibration The AntiVibration system uses sensors that monitor the load weight and movement of the drum to eliminate imbalances. Additionally 
   the design reinforces the structure of the sidewall and increases the stability of the dryer. This structure 
   combined with enhanced insulation  regulates noise levels and reduces vibration 
   making the WTW85470GB very quiet throughout the entire cycle.

Description: 
    A++ Energy Rating
   60cm Wide  Inox-look The KGN34NL3AG fridger-freezer looks absolutely superb in an inox stainless steel-look finish. With a 60/40 split and nearly 300 litres of total capacity there is plenty of room to store the family groceries as well. It is a NoFrost bottom freezer which means you'll never suffer those annoying build-ups of ice and frost 
   that take up so much room and stick your frozen goods together. You'll also never have to defrost your freezer ever again too. The freezer features an extra-deep BigBox frozen food drawer for practical stacking of frozen food containers or large frozen items like gateaux or pizzas. No matter whether you have to cater for a child's birthday or freeze a wedding cake - in the BigBox you will find more than enough room. The freezer also has SuperFreezing. This protects frozen food from defrosting when adding new food to the freezer 
   and the new food also freezes faster. Once the required temperature is reached 
   normal operation automatically resumes  preventing energy waste. The whole appliance benefits from the Multi Airflow System which provides even air distribution for longer freshness. The fan-assisted MultiAirflow System causes gentle 
   even currents of cold air to circulate at all levels of the chilling and freezing area. Temperature fluctuations are minimised and cooling times reduced - which helps your foods retain their flavour for longer. Energy efficient LED lights illuminate every corner of the fridge and last the appliance's lifetime. The fridge also features MultiBox - a transparent drawer with wave bottom 
   ideal for the storage of fruits and vegetables. There are also 4 safety glass shelves in the fridge compartment 
   of which 2 are height adjustable  and 1 large and 2 small door trays in the fridge door. It also has Perfect Fit which means it can be positioned right next to side walls and furniture.
