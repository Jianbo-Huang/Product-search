Title: Miele G4940SCCLST Freestanding Dishwasher
Description: 
    Clean Steel
  Built to last and tested for the equivalent of 20 years' normal use 
   the Miele G4940SC freestanding dishwasher will be a reassuring presence in any kitchen. This dishwasher has impressively low water consumption 
   partly thanks to sensor controlled washing programmes  helping it to achieve an economical A++ energy efficiency rating. Sensor control With two of its five wash programmes controlled by sensor to minimise water and energy consumption 
   this dishwasher makes a big contribution to conserving resources. It uses a light beam to measure how dirty the water is and adapts the wash programme accordingly. And it does this both for normal loads and 
   with a gentle touch  for glassware and china. Alternatively 
   you can just run the eco programme for an exceptionally economical wash. Under pressure Whatever programme you choose 
   you can speed things up by pressing the turbo button  reducing the cycle time by some 25% or more. Quicker washing is achieved by increasing the water pressure as well as the water temperature. Miele is believed to be the only dishwasher manufacturer to increase intensity of the wash by increasing the pressure of the water 
   as well as its temperature. Practical As you would expect from Miele 
   this dishwasher benefits from several well-thought-out  practical features from the removable cutlery tray onwards. The door is extremely easy to open and close 
   and stays open in any position. The lower  higher intensity wash basket offers a perfect position for each item of crockery. It can hold plates of various sizes (up to 35 cm diameter) in three rows. Chopping boards 
   serving platters and containers such as pots and pans can also be securely positioned. More features Capable of accommodating 14 place settings 
   this dishwasher keeps you informed of where you are in a wash cycle with a countdown indicator and it also offers a delay start option which can put off the start of a programme for up to 24 hours in advance. Programmes Eco Sensor Wash Sensor Wash Gentle Normal Intensive

Description: 
    Stainless Steel
  Designed for ceiling mounting above an island hob  the Bosch DIB091K50B cooker hood offers high extraction rates for 90cm-wide hobs. It is a rim-type unit with sensor control and it has an A energy rating. Operation Touch-sensitive controls operate the three-speed fan

   the hood returns to the regular setting. It also has an automatic ten-minute run-on after cooking has finished.    Filters The hood captures grease 
   odours and steam through two metallic grease filter cassettes. A grease saturation indicator shows when the filters need cleaning. They are easily removed and cleaned in a dishwasher.   Energy rating This Bosch hood has four low-energy LED lights to illuminate the cookto and an A rating for energy efficiency. It is also A-rated for fan and lighting efficiency 
   and B for grease filtering.   Air circulation mode This chimney hood can be converted to run in recirculation mode 
   provided there is an adequate air intake. Air circulation operation also requires an activated carbon filter. Bosch offers a conversion kit for recirculated extraction.

   90cm Wide  Stainless Steel With an enormous 373-litre capacity fridge and a 195-litre freezer 
   the Bosch KAN90VI20G American-style fridge freezer means you can store more and shop less. Incorporating no frost technology and touch-sensitive controls 
   this appliance has constant air circulation for longer freshness. Its sleek stainless steel finish will enhance any kitchen and it has an A+ energy rating. No frost Thanks to no frost technology 
   you need never defrost again. Moisture is collected on the central fin evaporator rather than building up in the appliance. Condensation is evacuated into a special collecting pan and lower humidity means that almost no frost or ice forms. From time to time 
   the chiller unit automatically defrosts the appliance. Consistent cooling A fan-assisted circulation system causes gentle 
   even currents of cold air at all levels of the chilling and freezing area. In this way 
   temperature fluctuations are minimised and cooling times reduced - which helps your foods retain their flavour and freshness. There are also fast freeze and fast cool facilities so food that's just been loaded into the fridge and freezer is cooled more quickly. At the same time 
   the systems stop stored prevent food from warming up. Both functions automatically return to preset operation. Independent control Two separate thermostats allow independent temperature control between the fridge and freezer 
   preventing the transference of humidity between the two sides. Touch-sensitive controls offer convenient temperature control via easy-to-read LED indicators. And alarms will warn you of any temperature increases and whether the freezer door has been left open. Versatile storage With six levels of storage 
   including two drawers in both fridge and freezer  this side-by-side appliance can easily accommodate any item you want to store. Sturdy safety glass shelves can support heavy casserole dishes 
   for example. Adjustable in-door trays mean you can adapt the space to suit individual needs for storing bottles and jars. A bright LED interior light helps you to locate particular items easily. Energy rating Low energy consumption means the appliance qualifies for an A+ energy rating.

Description: 
   Ideal for tackling medium lawns
   the Bosch Rotak 37 LI is an ergonomically designed lawnmower which will help you to mow for longer without discomfort. The Ergoflex system lets you operate the lawnmower with your left 
   right  or both hands  and in multiple directions. There are 8 different grip positions in total. Because the lawnmower is cordless 
   you'll be able to move around your garden freely without the risk of the cable getting cut or tangled 
   or flower beds getting damaged. You'll have the freedom to reach your whole lawn without needing a power source nearby. Efficient Energy Management will increase the run time of the 36V Lithium-ion battery by 10-20%. This works using intelligent cutting electronics which maintain a constant blade speed 
   and a kinetic energy recovery system which harnesses energy from the blade run-down and feeds it back to the battery as soon as the motor is turned off. The battery can run for up to 90 minutes 
   with a full charge taking 140 minutes. A cutting width of 37cm is ideal for medium lawn sizes 
   and there are 6 different height of cut positions to choose from 
   ranging between 20mm and 70mm  so you can choose the most appropriate setting for your lawn condition or to suit your preference. A large 
   40 litre grass box lets you spend more time mowing before you need to empty the grass cuttings 
   so you can finish the job with minimal interruptions. Give your lawn a stately 
 striped appearance using the rear roller.
