    Black/White
  Panasonic's premium combination model NN-CF853WBPQ has a 32 litre cavity and is designed to enable you to cook delicious and nutritious meals your family will love. Packed with innovative features as well as being easy to both use and clean 
   the microwave also features a modern but timeless design  making it the ideal addition to any contemporary kitchen. Panasonic's NN-CF853WBPQ microwave features a flatbed 
   rather than a turntable. The flatbed not only creates a larger cooking area 
   it also means you can place dishes of all shapes inside the oven. Unlike a turntable 
   which needs to be removed  the flatbed design is much easier to clean. Thanks to the 2-level convection cooking you can cook two levels simultaneously 
   to make even large families happier at mealtimes. A fan circulates the heat evenly throughout the oven so it reaches the food uniformly and efficiently 
   ideal for roasting and baking. Panasonic's microwave also features an intelligent Sensor Cooking option that makes preparing perfectly cooked food easier than ever before. The advanced new electrostatic touch panel with blue LED allows smart 
   easy setting operation with Swipe & Touch. Please note: For proper operation 
   the oven must have sufficient air flow i.e. 5cm at one side 
   the other being open; 15cm clear over the top; 10cm at the rear.

   it can be installed either way round  and either as an undermounted or inset sink. Made from Silgranit

Waste fitting with a space-saving pipe and a 3 1/2 basket strainer. Choose the perfect tap for your kitchen Below are a few options and features to consider when choosing your perfect kitchen tap. Taps are largely about style and preference although they can have several useful features: table.cq-sizeguidetable {width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font-family: Arial; font-size:12px; border-bottom:1px solid #f4f2ec; margin-top:10px;padding-bottom:1px;}table.cq-sizeguidetable th {border-width: 0px;padding: 8px;background-color: #dedbd2;}table.cq-sizeguidetable td {border-width: 0px;padding: 8px;border-style: none;}table.cq-sizeguidetable td:first-child {font-weight:bold;}.cq-sizeguidetable tr:nth-child(odd){background-color: #f4f2ec;} Aerators (also called flow constrictors) These are anti-splash 
   but also mix air with your water  creating a good pressure 
   at the same time as saving water. If you are simply rinsing plates or cutlery these can give a great saving. Filter taps These work in the same way as a water filter jug 
   except they filter as you draw water from the mains  therefore giving you limitless filtered water. They remove bacteria 
   chlorine and lead from the water supply. They also remove any pesticides and insecticides which may have got into the water system. Filtered water also helps reduce the build up of limescale in appliances. The filter cartridges for these taps need replacing every 6 months or so to retain effectiveness. Hot taps Use a mini-boiler under the sink to provide you with instant boiling (or hot) water. You no longer need to rely on kettles or saucepans to heat water before you make a cup of tea 
   or boil your veg - it comes instantly from the tap. Some taps can also provide you with chilled water for cold drinks 
   and even sparkling water. These are great if you like fizzy drinks 
   but prefer to avoid additional sugar - simply mix with your favourite cordial! - White - Composite Granite

   at the same time as saving water. If you are simply rinsing plates or cutlery these can give a great saving. Filter taps These work in the same way as a water filter jug 
   except they filter as you draw water from the mains  therefore giving you limitless filtered water. They remove bacteria 
   chlorine and lead from the water supply. They also remove any pesticides and insecticides which may have got into the water system. Filtered water also helps reduce the build up of limescale in appliances. The filter cartridges for these taps need replacing every 6 months or so to retain effectiveness. Hot taps Use a mini-boiler under the sink to provide you with instant boiling (or hot) water. You no longer need to rely on kettles or saucepans to heat water before you make a cup of tea 
   or boil your veg - it comes instantly from the tap. Some taps can also provide you with chilled water for cold drinks 
   and even sparkling water. These are great if you like fizzy drinks 
   but prefer to avoid additional sugar - simply mix with your favourite cordial! - Alumetallic - Composite Granite

   this material comes in beautiful colours with a natural stone-like look. It's 80% granite to suit kitchen use and is easy to care for 
   durable  non-fading  naturally scratch resistant  heat resistant to 280°C and perfect for use with food. Bowl depth: 175mm. Cut-out size: 680 x 500mm. Waste fitting with a space-saving pipe and a 3 1/2 basket strainer. Choose the perfect tap for your kitchen Below are a few options and features to consider when choosing your perfect kitchen tap. Taps are largely about style and preference although they can have several useful features: table.cq-sizeguidetable {width:100%; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font-family: Arial; font-size:12px; border-bottom:1px solid #f4f2ec; margin-top:10px;padding-bottom:1px;}table.cq-sizeguidetable th {border-width: 0px;padding: 8px;background-color: #dedbd2;}table.cq-sizeguidetable td {border-width: 0px;padding: 8px;border-style: none;}table.cq-sizeguidetable td:first-child {font-weight:bold;}.cq-sizeguidetable tr:nth-child(odd){background-color: #f4f2ec;} Aerators (also called flow constrictors) These are anti-splash 
   but also mix air with your water  creating a good pressure 
   at the same time as saving water. If you are simply rinsing plates or cutlery these can give a great saving. Filter taps These work in the same way as a water filter jug 
   except they filter as you draw water from the mains  therefore giving you limitless filtered water. They remove bacteria 
   chlorine and lead from the water supply. They also remove any pesticides and insecticides which may have got into the water system. Filtered water also helps reduce the build up of limescale in appliances. The filter cartridges for these taps need replacing every 6 months or so to retain effectiveness. Hot taps Use a mini-boiler under the sink to provide you with instant boiling (or hot) water. You no longer need to rely on kettles or saucepans to heat water before you make a cup of tea 
   or boil your veg - it comes instantly from the tap. Some taps can also provide you with chilled water for cold drinks 
   and even sparkling water. These are great if you like fizzy drinks 
   but prefer to avoid additional sugar - simply mix with your favourite cordial! - Jasmine - Composite Granite

   the Kubus sink from Franke has a smooth lined  geometric feel with one and a half deep set bowls. Made from composite granite 
   this durable design will work hard for you and your kitchen. Its stylish colour is part of a coordinating range but also works on its own as a contrasting feature of the kitchen. Key features: Cabinet Size: 600mm Bowl Size: 340mm x 400mm x 210mm Small Bowl Size: 160mm x 400mm x 130mm 25 year guarantee included Composite granite is a material that's made to simulate granite and stone 
   but enables the sink shape to be moulded. Granite particles are bonded together with synthetic materials to create a smoother 
   flatter surface. It is also far more difficult for residue 
   food particles and bacteria to accumulate in between the granules 
   which greatly improves hygiene  and reduces lime scale build-up. This material is highly resistant to heat 
   impact and staining making it the perfect choice for your kitchen sink. - Coffee - Granite Composite

Description: 
   Featuring one and a half bowls
   the Kubus sink comes in a choice of Onyx and Polar White Fragranite finishes offering a durable kitchen design with timeless appeal. It includes a Lira 2 plumbing kit.

Bowl sizes: 340 x 400 x 210 and 160 x 400 x 130mm Overall sink dimension: 558 x 480mm Minimum cabinet size: 600mm Composite granite is a material that's made to simulate granite and stone 
   but enables the sink shape to be moulded. Granite particles are bonded together with synthetic materials to create a smoother 
   flatter surface. It is also far more difficult for residue 
   food particles and bacteria to accumulate in between the granules 
   which greatly improves hygiene  and reduces lime scale build-up . This material is highly resistant to heat 
   impact and staining making it the perfect choice for your kitchen sink. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in all of our shops. For more information

   the Typos kitchen sink boasts a clean and linear design which will suit a variety of interior styles. Made from Schock's signature Cristalite 
   it offers a clean and food-safe surface with special hygienic protection provided by natural silver icons which reduce bacterial growth by up to 95%. Composite granite is a material that's made to simulate granite and stone 
   but enables the sink shape to be moulded. Granite particles are bonded together with synthetic materials to create a smoother 
   flatter surface. It is also far more difficult for residue 
   food particles and bacteria to accumulate in between the granules 
   which greatly improves hygiene  and reduces lime scale build-up . This material is highly resistant to heat 
   impact and staining making it the perfect choice for your kitchen sink. Please note: not all our ranges are on display in all of our shops. For more information
